Hello! I am Güven Erkaya. I am an electrical and computer engineer. My interests are computer vision and deep learning, robotics and AI in Medicine. I have a bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering and Information Technology from Technical University of Munich (TUM). [Here](https://github.com/guvenerkaya/guvenerkaya/blob/main/bachelor_thesis.pdf), you can have a look at my bachelor's thesis. It's about evalation of high level concepts such as facial expression detection in induced emotion prediction from video content. I'm currently pursuing my master's degree in Robotics Cognition Intelligence at TUM. You can reach me under erkayaguven@gmail.com.
